title: A House unto My Name
description: Nauvoo. It means “beautiful” in Hebrew, though it was more an expression of faith than an accurate description, at least at first. Meanwhile, the Lord was impressing His Prophet with a sense of urgency. He had more truths and ordinances to restore, and He needed a holy temple where He could “crown [His Saints] with honor, immortality, and eternal life”

## Historical Context

Key Themes:

Enduring persecution with faith.

The Lord’s timing and compassion: “My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment.” (v. 7)

True priesthood power flows from righteousness, not control or compulsion (vv. 34-46).

### Section 121

**Setting**: Prophet Joseph Smith and companions imprisoned in Liberty Jail, Missouri (March 1839).

**Backdrop**: The Saints are fleeing Missouri as a result of* the extermination order.

**Content**: Prayer, lament, and revelation on suffering, patience, and priesthood power.

**Official Heading** Prayer and prophecies excerpted from two epistles to the Church dictated by Joseph Smith the Prophet while he was a prisoner in the jail at Liberty, Missouri, the first dated March 20, 1839, and the second composed around March 22. The Prophet and several companions had been months in prison. Their petitions and appeals directed to various government officials had failed to bring them relief.

### Section 124

**Setting**: Revelation given January 19, 1841 in Nauvoo, Illinois, after the Saints’ relocation.

**Backdrop**: Saints are rebuilding after persecution — establishing a new home and headquarters.

**Content**: Commandment to build:

- The Nauvoo Temple — “a house unto my name”
- The Nauvoo House — a public house for visitors and gathering.

**Official Heading** Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illinois, January 19, 1841. Because of increasing persecutions and illegal procedures against them by public officers, the Saints had been compelled to leave Missouri. The exterminating order issued by Lilburn W. Boggs, governor of Missouri, dated October 27, 1838, had left them no alternative. In 1841, when this revelation was given, the city of Nauvoo, occupying the site of the former village of Commerce, Illinois, had been built up by the Saints, and here the headquarters of the Church had been established.
