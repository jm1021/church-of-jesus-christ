    "  - `src`, `pixels`, `SCALE_FACTOR` — used to compute on-screen size from the spritesheet's pixel dimensions.\n",
    "  - `INIT_POSITION` — computed here from `window.innerHeight` so the sprite spawns near the bottom of the screen.\n",

    "  - `keypress` — numeric key codes for movement; keeps input mapping in data rather than scattering it across code.\n",

    "- **Purpose:** Shows the standard modal mini-game pattern: create an overlay canvas, attach input handlers, run an rAF loop, and clean up on exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key ideas:**\n",
    "  - **Bound handlers:** store the bound function references (`this._keyDown`) so `removeEventListener` works correctly — a common source of leaks/bugs is removing a different function than the one added.\n",
    "  - **Overlay canvas:** using a fixed-position canvas isolates the mini-game visually and input-wise from the main overworld. Use `z-index` to ensure it sits above UI but below dialog overlays if needed.\n",
    "  - **requestAnimationFrame loop:** preferred over `setInterval` for smooth frame pacing and to allow browsers to throttle when tabs are inactive.\n",
    "  - **Safe teardown:** always cancel rAF and remove DOM nodes/listeners to avoid leaked references and stray updates after exit.\n",

    "## Practical Tips \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keep your world consistent:**  \n",
    "  Make sure everything in your game (players, enemies, and backgrounds), uses the same “map” or coordinate system.  \n",
    "  If you use both the **canvas** and regular **web page elements (DOM)**, convert their positions carefully so things line up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check if images are ready before using them:**  \n",
    "  Before drawing pictures or sprites, make sure they’ve finished loading by checking `img.complete`.  \n",
    "  This prevents errors or missing graphics while your game runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load everything first:**  \n",
    "  Try to **preload** your images, sounds, and data before starting the level.  \n",
    "  This helps your game feel smoother and prevents lag when something new appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start simple with visuals:**  \n",
    "  When testing cool effects (like explosions or sparkles), you can first use regular HTML boxes (`<div>`s).  \n",
    "  Later, move those effects into the **canvas** or use **object pooling** if you need better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Don't Commit unless you know it is working:** \n",
    "  You can do this by using make, as you were taught. Add things one by one! For example, if you add an NPC and it works, thats when you commit it. If it doesn't work, keep running it through make until it does!\n"

    "## Performance & Optimization Tips \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother motion:**  \n",
    "  Instead of using `setInterval`, use `requestAnimationFrame` when making things move or animate.  \n",
    "  It keeps your game running in sync with the screen’s refresh rate, which makes animations look smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Make particles faster with canvas:**  \n",
    "  If you have lots of small effects (like sparks or explosions), using too many HTML elements (`<div>`s) can slow things down.  \n",
    "  Drawing them on the **canvas** instead — and reusing (pooling) them — helps your game run faster and use less memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keep your math organized:**  \n",
    "  Use one system for positions and movement (like “world coordinates”) and stick to it.  \n",
    "  Don’t mix up screen positions from `getBoundingClientRect()` with your game’s own coordinates — it’ll make collisions and movement more accurate and easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use browser tools to check performance:**  \n",
    "  Open your browser’s **developer tools** and look at things like frame rate (FPS), paint time, and memory use.  \n",
    "  This helps you spot what’s slowing your game down and fix it early.\n"

    "## Pitfalls & Quick Fixes \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event listeners not removing correctly:**  \n",
    "  When you add event listeners (like key presses), make sure you save the exact function you used to add them.  \n",
    "  You have to use the same reference when removing them — otherwise, they stay active and can cause bugs or weird behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unreliable collision checks:**  \n",
    "  Don’t rely on the browser’s element positions (like `getBoundingClientRect()`) for hit detection.  \n",
    "  Instead, keep all your objects (player, enemies, walls) in the same shared coordinate system inside your `gameEnv`.  \n",
    "  This keeps collision math consistent and easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game restarting too harshly:**  \n",
    "  Try not to use `window.location.reload()` to restart the game.  \n",
    "  Instead, make a **soft reset** — clear the current level, reset positions and variables, and start again smoothly without reloading the whole page.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Images or sounds not loading:**  \n",
    "  Sometimes assets fail to load, especially if the file path is wrong or loads too slowly.  \n",
    "  Always check if an image is ready before drawing it, and if it’s missing, show a simple backup or “loading” message instead of letting the game crash.\n"

    "  This keeps players from getting confused or lost during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Let players customize controls:**  \n",

    "  On phones or tablets, include easy-to-tap on-screen buttons so everyone can play comfortably.\n",
    "\n",

    "  Also, let players lower the number of visual effects (like particles or flashes) if their device is slower.\n",
