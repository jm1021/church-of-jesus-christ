All code cells below are taken from that notebook (unchanged or only lightly formatted) so you can study how `class`, `__init__`, methods, and object collaboration work in a real example. This will be a comprehensive guide about class methods, and how they can be applied into your code projects!"

    "- **How to define classes with `__init__` and instance variables**  \n",
    "  You'll see how to create a class in Python, use the `__init__` method to set up initial state, and store data in instance variables that are unique to each object.\n",
    "- **How to add methods that operate on instance state**  \n",
    "  Learn how to write functions (methods) inside a class that can access and modify the object's data, making your code more organized and reusable.\n",
    "- **How classes collaborate (composition)**  \n",
    "  Understand how one class can use another class as a building block, allowing you to break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",
    "- **How to test classes with short demos**  \n",
    "  Practice writing small test cases or demo code to check that your classes and methods work as expected, helping you catch bugs early and build confidence in your code."

    "### How a class works\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It groups data (attributes) and behavior (methods) that belong together.\n",
    "Think of a class like a blueprint for a car; each car you create from that blueprint is an instance with its own state (color, mileage).\n",
    "__init__ is a special method Python calls automatically when you create (instantiate) an object.\n",
    "Purpose: initialize the instance’s attributes (its state).\n",
    "Signature pattern: def __init__(self, ...) — self is the new instance being created."
