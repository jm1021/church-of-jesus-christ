    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this lesson, you'll connect what you've already explored in game code to the formal concepts of JavaScript variables, data types, and objects. We'll explore how these ideas power both games and interactive web pages. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson Goal:**\n",
    "- Understand how JavaScript variables and objects work, and why they matter in both games and web development.\n",
    "- Practice using `let` and `const`, object literals, classes, and dot notation.\n",
    "- See how the same patterns apply to manipulating HTML elements (the DOM) with JavaScript.\n",

    "## Primitive Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In game development, understanding the different data types in JavaScript is crucial for managing the various elements and attributes of a game or web site. Each type plays a unique role in creating a dynamic and interactive experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring Variables: `let` vs `const`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create (declare) a variable in JavaScript, you usually use either `let` or `const`:\n",
    "- Use `let` when you want to create a variable that can change (mutable). For example, a player's score or health, which may go up or down during the game.\n",
    "- Use `const` when you want to create a variable that should not be reassigned (immutable). For example, a player's name after login, or a unique ID for a game object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each declared variable is given a type by JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number**:\n",
    "   - Represents numerical values, health and timeInMilliSeconds\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **String**:\n",
    "   - Represents text, such as the user's name or keypress.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Boolean**:\n",
    "   - Represents true/false values, such as isAlive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Undefined**:\n",
    "   - Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Null**:\n",
    "   - Represents the intentional absence of any object value, such as an empty inventory slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Symbol**:\n",
    "   - Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as unique identifiers for game objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **BigInt**:\n",
    "   - Represents very large integers, such as the total number of points accumulated over many games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a reference type, it is typically declared with `const` so the reference (the link to the object or array) does not change. However, the values inside the object or array can still be updated as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Object**:\n",
    "   - Represents a collection of key-value pairs, such as a player's attributes or game settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Array**:\n",
    "   - Represents an ordered collection of values, such as a list of high scores or inventory items.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Function**:\n",
    "   - Represents a block of code designed to perform a specific task, such as attacking an enemy or saving the game."

    "## JavaScript Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects in JavaScript are a way to group related variables (properties) and functions (methods) together. This lets you model real-world things or game elements in your code. For example, in a simple game, you might have a `GameObject` to represent a player, enemy, or item.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Literals\n",
    "You can create an object using curly braces `{}` and define its properties and methods inside:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const player = {\n",
    "  name: 'Mario',\n",
    "  score: 0,\n",

    "console.log(player.name); // Access property with dot notation\n",
    "player.jump(); // Call method with dot notation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Instances\n",
    "For more complex games, you can define a class and create multiple objects (instances) from it. This is how the `GameObject` works in your game code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "class GameObject {\n",
    "  constructor(name, x, y) {\n",
    "    this.name = name;\n",

    "  move(dx, dy) {\n",

    "player.move(5, 3);\n",
    "console.log(player.x, player.y); // 5 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dot Notation\n",
    "You use dot notation to access or change properties and methods of an object:\n",
    "- `object.property` to get or set a value\n",
    "- `object.method()` to call a function\n",

    "## HTML variables and the DOM as an Object Store\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with JavaScript, one of its primary purposes is to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. The DOM is a structured representation of the HTML elements on the page, and you can think of it as a giant object store. Each element in the DOM is an object, and you can access and manipulate these objects using JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding and Using References\n",
    "To interact with an element, you first find a reference to it—often using methods like `getElementById` or `querySelector`. This is similar to how you work with object literals in JavaScript: you get a reference to an object, and then you can read or change its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dot Notation and Attributes\n",
    "Once you have a reference to a DOM element, you use dot notation to access or modify its attributes and properties. For example, you can change the `style`, `textContent`, or other properties directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const button = document.getElementById('my-btn'); // Get a reference to the button element\n",
    "button.style.backgroundColor = 'blue'; // Change the background color\n",
    "button.textContent = 'Clicked!'; // Change the button text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very similar to how you interact with any JavaScript object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const player = { name: 'Mario', score: 100 };\n",
    "player.score += 10; // Update the score property\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "Understanding that HTML elements are objects lets you use all your knowledge of variables, data types, and object manipulation in JavaScript to create interactive and dynamic web pages. The DOM is your playground, and JavaScript is the tool you use to shape it."
