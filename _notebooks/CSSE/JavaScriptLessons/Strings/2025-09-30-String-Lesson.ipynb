    "### String basics (literals, escaping, indexing, slicing)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quotes: use single `'...'` or double `\"...\"` quotes for strings. Triple quotes `'''...'''` or `\"\"\"...\"\"\"` are for multi-line strings.\n",
    "- Escape sequences: `\\n` (newline), `\\t` (tab), `\\\"` and `\\'` for embedded quotes; use raw strings `r'...'` to avoid processing escapes (useful for file paths/regex).\n",
    "- Indexing: `s[0]` is the first character, `s[-1]` is the last.\n",
    "- Slicing: `s[start:end]` (end is exclusive), e.g. `s[:3]`, `s[3:]`, `s[::-1]` reverses a string.\n",
    "- Strings are immutable: you cannot assign to `s[0]` â€” operations return new strings instead.\n",
    "- Formatting: f-strings `f\"{name} is {age}\"` and `format()` are common for building strings.\n",
