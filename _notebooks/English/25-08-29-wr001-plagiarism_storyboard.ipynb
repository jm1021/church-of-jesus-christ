    "Literature has shaped culture and society through memorable phrases that continue to resonate today. For example, “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times” captures the contrasts of life in a way that still feels relevant (Dickens, 1859/2003, p. 1). Another famous phrase, “Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?” highlights themes of love and longing (Shakespeare, 1597/1997, 2.2.33). Likewise, in film and popular culture, lines such as “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn” remain recognized across generations (Selznick, 1939).\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples illustrate how literature and media are not confined to classrooms but influence our shared language and thinking. Yet, while these quotes are widely used, few students pause to reflect on their origins. A research-based approach to literature should require proper acknowledgment of sources, which strengthens credibility and avoids plagiarism.\n",
