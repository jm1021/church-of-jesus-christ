   - Shows visual indicator when name is auto-filled (green border + hint text)
   - Works for both main submission and reply forms
   - No need to type your name every time - just like social media!

   - Each submission becomes its own thread
   - Anyone can add replies/feedback under each submission
   - Replies show author name and timestamp
   - Visual threading with indentation and borders
   - Reply count displayed for each thread

4. **Local Storage:**
   - Automatically saves all submissions and replies to browser's localStorage

## How to Use in Any Lesson

Simply add this line at the end of your lesson content (before the closing `</div>`):

```liquid
{%- include grading-feedback.html -%}
```

## Example Implementation

See `/hacks/pong/2025-09-03-P0lesson.md` for a working example.

The grading feedback section will appear after all lesson content and before the utterances comments section (if enabled with `comments: True` in frontmatter).

## Customization

To customize the styling or options, edit `/Users/akshay/pages/_includes/grading-feedback.html`

### Common Customizations:

1. **Change grade options:** Edit the `<select>` dropdown options
2. **Modify colors:** Update the CSS variables and color values
3. **Add more fields:** Add new form groups in the HTML
4. **Change storage key:** Modify the `STORAGE_KEY` variable in the script

## Storage Structure

Data is stored in localStorage with the key: `lesson_grading_feedback_[page_url]`

Each submission thread includes:
- id (unique identifier)
- studentName
- gradeReceived
- additionalComments
- timestamp (auto-generated)
- pageUrl (auto-generated)
- pageTitle (auto-generated)
- replies (array of reply objects)

Each reply includes:
- id (unique identifier)
- author (name of person replying)
- content (reply text)
