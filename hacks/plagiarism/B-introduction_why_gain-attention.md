## The Power and Peril of Words

Literature has shaped culture and society through memorable phrases that continue to resonate today. For example, `"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"` captures the contrasts of life in a way that still feels relevant. Another famous phrase, `"Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?"` has been quoted in countless settings as a symbol of love and longing. Likewise, in film and popular culture, lines such as `"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"` are recognized across generations.

**But what if someone claimed these words as their own?**

## Your Story Matters - Come Prepared

Create a sample story or paragraph that you can use at various times in this workshop! It is better if this example is in early stages and unrefined. The example paragraph on "Literature..." above is an example that needs workshop attention.

**Mindset preparation:** Before we begin, think of a time when:

- You worked really hard on something and someone else took credit
- You accidentally used someone's idea without giving credit
- You saw plagiarism happen in school, work, or online

*We'll need your sample and mindset throughout this workshop to make the learning personal and meaningful.*
