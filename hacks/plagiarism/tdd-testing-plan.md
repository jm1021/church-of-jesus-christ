## Success Metrics for TDD Approach

### Testing Process Success

- Students complete all modules within time limits
- Groups provide specific, actionable feedback
- Students understand connection to their own quest building
- Energy remains high throughout testing session

### Content Improvement Success

- Clear patterns emerge in feedback (not random complaints)
- Specific UI elements consistently rated high/low
- Difficulty rankings cluster around appropriate levels
- Students express genuine interest in using final version

### Learning Transfer Success

- Students reference this experience when building own quests
- Groups naturally discuss user experience principles
- Students ask to test each other's prototypes
- Quality of student projects improves based on testing awareness

This TDD approach transforms testing from evaluation into collaboration - students become co-creators of the quest while learning essential UX skills for their own projects!
