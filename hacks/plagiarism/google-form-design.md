## Data Analysis Setup

### **Automatic Charts to Enable:**

- Question 9, 21: Difficulty ratings (histogram)
- Question 38: Overall ratings (histogram)  
- Questions 4, 7, 10: UI element preferences (pie charts)
- Question 2: Class period distribution (pie chart)
- Questions 12, 14: Task difficulty assessments (stacked bar)

### **Key Metrics to Track:**

1. **Completion Rate:** % who finish entire form
2. **Difficulty Patterns:** Average ratings per module
3. **UI Preferences:** Most/least popular elements
4. **Learning Transfer:** % who say experience helps their projects
5. **Recommendation Rate:** % who would recommend to others

### **Cross-Analysis Opportunities:**

- Difficulty ratings vs. overall satisfaction
- UI preferences by class period
- Learning transfer by overall rating
- Completion rate by testing location

## Implementation Tips

### **Before Testing:**

- Create form and test with 2-3 students first
- Set up automatic email notifications for responses
- Prepare sharing link and QR code for easy access
- Brief students on time management (25-30 min total)

### **During Testing:**

- Share form link at start: "Complete C1-C4, then fill sections 1-6"
- Announce time checks: "5 minutes for C1 feedback"
- Show C5/C6 demo when groups reach section 7
- Encourage honest feedback: "Help make this better!"

### **After Testing:**

- Download responses as Excel for deeper analysis
- Create summary report within 48 hours
- Share key findings with students to show impact
- Use data to prioritize improvement sprints

### **Form Settings:**

- Collect names (for follow-up if needed)
- Allow response editing (in case groups want to revise)
- Require sign-in (prevents duplicate responses)
- Limit to 1 response per account (groups share login)

This Google Form structure will give you rich, analyzable data from all 100 students while teaching them practical user testing methods they can apply to their own quest projects!
