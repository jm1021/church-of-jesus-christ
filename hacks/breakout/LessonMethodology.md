# How Game Lessons Connect to Gagné & Merrill

## Gagné’s Nine Events of Instruction

1. **Gain Attention**  
   - Game visuals and interactivity (scrolling background, Rock Paper Scissors console play) capture learner curiosity.

2. **Inform Learners of Objectives**  
   - Each lesson provides clear goals: transfer files, run code, comment key blocks, customize objects, apply OOP.

3. **Stimulate Recall of Prior Learning**  
   - Lessons prompt learners to recall prior concepts (HTML, JavaScript, OOP basics) before applying them to new tasks.

4. **Present the Content**  
   - Content is broken into manageable chunks:  
     - HTML for structure  
     - JavaScript for logic  
     - OOP for organization  
   - Supported by code walkthroughs and inline comments.

5. **Provide Learning Guidance**  
   - Checkpoints, hints, and guided questions steer students toward correct understanding.  
   - Example: “What happens when you change the sprite image?”

6. **Elicit Performance (Practice)**  
   - Students practice actively: modifying YAML, typing console commands, customizing game objects.

7. **Provide Feedback**  
   - Instant system feedback (console results, canvas visuals).  
   - Peer and teacher feedback during trio/live share activities.

8. **Assess Performance**  
   - Checkpoints and hacks serve as performance assessments (comment Player update, create new scene, customize buttons).

9. **Enhance Retention & Transfer**  
   - Lessons encourage extending mechanics to new contexts (Background → Flappy Bird, RPS → custom animations).

## Merrill’s First Principles of Instruction

1. **Problem-Centered**  
   - Lessons framed as real problems:  
     - “How do you get the background game to run?”  
     - “How do you control Rock Paper Scissors through the console?”

2. **Activation**  
   - Students recall and apply prior coding skills (syntax, DOM, functions).

3. **Demonstration**  
   - Teachers and lessons model solutions:  
     - Code walkthroughs (GameWorld, playRPS).  
     - Visual demonstrations (scrolling animations, button behaviors).

4. **Application**  
   - Learners actively apply skills: editing code, running console commands, customizing sprites and buttons.

5. **Integration**  
   - Students extend learning:  
     - Modify or invent new scenes.  
     - Apply console/debugging skills to real-world web apps.  
     - Use OOP for larger projects.

## Summary of Methodologies

- **Gagné’s Nine Events** provide the **flow of instruction**: attention → guidance → practice → assessment → transfer.  
- **Merrill’s First Principles** provide the **depth of learning**: activate → demonstrate → apply → integrate.  
- Together, these frameworks transform game-based coding lessons into structured, transferable learning experiences.
