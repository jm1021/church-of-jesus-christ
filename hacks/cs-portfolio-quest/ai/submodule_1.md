# Module 1: Resume & Interview Prep

## Resume Optimization

### What Actually Works:

1. **Upload your resume to an ATS checker** (like Jobscan or Resume Worded)
2. **Get specific feedback** on keyword gaps for target jobs
3. **Use AI to transform weak bullets** into STAR format with metrics

### Example Transformation:

**Before:**
```
Worked on team projects
```

**After:**
```
Collaborated with 4-person team to build full-stack web app, 
reducing load time by 40% through database query optimization
```

---

## Quick Exercise (10 min)

Follow these steps to improve your resume bullets:

1. **Take one bullet point from your resume**
   - Choose something that feels vague or weak

2. **Ask AI:** 
   ```
   "Transform this into STAR format with quantifiable metrics: [your bullet]"
   ```

3. **Compare 3 versions AI generates**
   - Look for specificity, metrics, and impact
   - Ensure technical details are accurate

4. **Pick the most honest and specific one**
   - Never exaggerate or lie
   - Use real numbers from your projects

---

## Mock Interviews That Matter

Skip the generic prep. Do this instead:

- **Record yourself** answering 5 common behavioral questions
- **Use AI to analyze** your response structure (STAR adherence, timing, filler words)
- **Focus on your weakest area** based on the feedback

### The 3 Questions You Must Nail:

1. **"Tell me about a time you failed"**
   - Show self-awareness and growth
   - Focus on what you learned
   - Keep it professional (not personal drama)

2. **"Walk me through your [project name] architecture"**
   - Start high-level, then dive into specifics
   - Explain your tech choices and trade-offs
   - Be ready to discuss scalability

3. **"Why are you interested in this company?"**
   - Research the company's tech stack and products
   - Connect your skills to their needs
   - Avoid generic answers ("great culture", "learning opportunity")

## Practice Tips

### For Resume Optimization:
- Focus on your top 3-5 experiences
- Use action verbs: Built, Implemented, Optimized, Led, Designed
- Include technologies: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS, etc.
- Quantify everything: users, speed improvements, cost savings

### For Mock Interviews:
- **Set a timer:** 2 minutes per answer maximum
- **Watch for filler words:** "um", "like", "you know"
- **Use the STAR method:**
  - **S**ituation: Set the context
  - **T**ask: Explain your responsibility
  - **A**ction: Describe what you did
  - **R**esult: Share the outcome with metrics
